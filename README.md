## What is Vice?

Vice is a **V**ideo **I**nstructional **C**hess **E**ngine, written in C.

It was (is) written as part of the follow along series you YouTube by Bluefever Software.

Vice is deliberately simplified - the code structure is by no means to be considered best practice, rather a quick start into understanding the world of computer chesss engine programming.

## Where can I get the binaries and what is the latest version?

You can find the download to the latest release (Vice 1.1) here:

## I want to copy it, can I?

You can do whatever you want with the code. A lot of engines have been inspired by Vice - not all give credit. Probably it's better to give credit than not.

## What are the main features?

Vice is simple, with the following features:

- Alpha beta search
- Iterative deepening
- Quiescence search
- Transposition table
  - Always replace
- Polyglot opening books
- MVV/LVA move ordering
- Basic evaluation

## bugs to fix:
- The PickMove function needs a BestScore of -(very low) instead of 0
- Time management for x moves in x minutes causes losses
- ID loop needs to only exit when it has a legal move (i.e done depth 1 at least)

## Who actually did this?

The real person behind the series is Richard Allbert.
