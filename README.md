## What is Vice?

Vice is a **V**ideo **I**nstructional **C**hess **E**ngine, written in C.

It was (is) written as part of the follow along series you YouTube by Bluefever Software.

Vice is deliberately simplified - the code structure is by no means to be considered best practice, rather a quick start into understanding the world of computer chesss engine programming.

You can find the download to the latest release (Vice 1.1) here:

## I want to copy it, can I?

You can do whatever you want with the code. A lot of engines have been inspired by Vice - not all give credit. Probably it's better to give credit than not.
